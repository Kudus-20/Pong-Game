I designed a Game Over interface that is displayed when the ball misses the paddles and hits the vertical walls of the window.


I also added code to make the ball color change randomly whenever it hits a paddle. 


I also made the ball accelerate whenever it hits a paddle. 


The initial direction of the ball is also made random
